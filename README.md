gulc_survey
===========

Given extra time, we would have liked to implement:

- Under create survey view, show each question created and its coresponding choices in a single box.

- be able to edit questions and choices after you create them.

-allow survey creator to pick what users can take a particular survey.  (maybe a secret URL?)

-have different options for answer type in addition to multiple choice.
